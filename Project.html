        <h3>Sparkathon-Walmart Hackathon</h3>
        <p>
          Frontend UI using React for a sustainable shopping application where users
          upload bills, earn a green score, and compete on a community leaderboard
          for rewards. I designed and implemented the login, signup, landing page,
          and leaderboard interfaces with a strong focus on usability and user
          experience.

        <h3>Handheld Game Console (Embedded Systems Project)</h3>
        <p>
          Developed a handheld game console using an STM32 microcontroller, LCD
          screen, and a 16-LED display. The system features two games including a
          platform runner and a memory game, designed to demonstrate real-time
          input handling, display control, and embedded system programming. This
          project was completed as a group-based embedded systems project.

        <h3>Emoji Game</h3>
        <p>
          An interactive React game with three difficulty levels, easy, medium,
          and hard, where an emotion is displayed and players must match it with
          the correct emoji. The game focuses on state management and conditional
          rendering.

        <h3>TR-6 Multimodal Fruit Lifecycle Dataset</h3>
        <p>
          Published the TR-6 dataset on Figshare, comprising Thermal IR-Fusion
          images, sRGB images, and methane concentration readings to capture
          visual, thermal, and chemical changes in fruits from unripe to spoiled
          stages. The dataset includes 10,000+ images per split across six fruit
          types and is provided without preprocessing, making it suitable for
          machine learning, computer vision, and data-driven research
          applications.
